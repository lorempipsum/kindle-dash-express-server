They should all be from a first-person perspective, with a theme of insanity.\n\nTopic: Breakfast\nResponse: He always stops crying when I pour the milk on his cereal. I just have to remember not to let him see his face on the carton.\n    \nTopic: Moon and The Soviets\nResponse: The Soviets were the first to learn about the Anomaly when they sent a manned mission to the Lunar surface. They never returned home.\n\nTopic: Moon\nResponse: I can hear them sometimes, scratching at the door of my airlock. I don't know how they got here, but I know they're not human.\n\nTopic: Moon demons\nResponse: I am the only one left. The others, they couldn't take it.  I can hear the Moon whispering to me sometimes, telling me to come outside and play.\n\nTopic: Moon face\nResponse: I wake up in a cold sweat. I can't shake the feeling that there's something wrong with the Moon. That it's watching me.\n\nTopic: Moon spiders\nResponse: I can feel them crawling on me, inside my suit. I knew there was something wrong with this mission. I should have never come to the Moon.\n\nTopic: Moon soviets\nResponse: I am the last of my unit. We were sent to investigate the Soviet base on the Moon, but we found something else entirely. I can still hear their screams in my nightmares.\n\nTopic: Moon gods\nResponse: They're coming for me. I can feel it. The Moon is their eyes, and they are coming to take me away.\n\nTopic: Moon Cosmos\nResponse: I am lost in the Cosmos. I float aimlessly through the void, forever alone. The only light in this darkness is the Moon, and it mocks me with its bright face.\n\nTopic: Moon Russians\nResponse: I can see them, even now. The Russians, crawling across the lunar surface. They come for me in my dreams, and I wake up screaming.\n\nTopic: Moon Capitalism\nResponse: I am a ghost. I haunt this lunar base, these halls that were once my home. I can't rest until the capitalists are driven from this place. From all of our places.\n\nTopic: Moon Americans\nResponse: I can hear them, even now. The Americans, laughing and joking as they walk on the Moon. They have no idea what's coming for them.\n\nTopic: Moon Lost\nResponse: I am lost on the Moon. I wander these hallways, searching for a way home. But there is no home for me now, only the cold embrace of the Moon.\n\nTopic: Moon Dementia\nResponse: I can feel myself slipping. I forget my name, my mission. The only thing that is real to me now is the Moon, and her bright face that smiles down on me in the darkness.\n\nTopic: Moon visions\nResponse:  The Moon, the stars, the planets. They're all dark. Yet I still see them, even when I close my eyes.\n\nTopic: Moon darkness\nResponse: The darkness is everywhere. It surrounds me, suffocates me. I can't escape it, no matter how hard I try.\n\nTopic: ${topic}\nResponse:`,
